    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As my first technical post I am going to talk about my experience that I recently had trying to incorporate testing into a project that I was working on. Before this, I never thought twice about building test ready code, so I knew this was going to be a challenge. I decided to go with the third-party libray pytest because there was a bunch of information out there about it and a lot of developers recommend using it. Also, there is a book out there by Brian Okken, called  ‘Python Testing with pytest’ that was a great resource.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Wowsers, you know I never thought that I would have one of these but how look at how quickly it can change. The primary purpose of my blog will be to capture topics that interest me. It is very easy to forget information that you recently just learned so I am hoping this blog will help reinforce that information in my head. Also, I’ll be able to reference back to my posts and hopefully jog my memory on what I have learned ;-).&lt;/p&gt;
